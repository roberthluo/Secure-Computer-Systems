I am using an linux environment for this task, and python as my language, specifically Cryptography. 
I choose an linux environment for this because of it's robustness in security due to it's smaller userbase and more technologically more literate.
I choose python because Python is a easy scripting language, and has many easy to use libraries like Cryptography. 
Cryptography is the primary cryptography library for python and has both high level recipes and common cryptographic algorithms.
